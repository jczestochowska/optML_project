# Optimizing Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning

To run the experiments described in report and generate relevant plots please run: `run.ipynb`, experiments take a lot of time and were run on google colab with GPU, due to different PyTorhc CUDA setups there may be some numerical inconsistencies. 

- `src` contains all the source code, which is also contained in `run.ipynb`, functions responsible for data loading, weights quantization, training and testing in federated learning simulations
- `definitions` contains some global project's variables
-  `notebooks` contains some scratch files and an `experiments_colab` notebook with the same content as in `run.ipynb` without plotting
